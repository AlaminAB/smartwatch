        <p><strong>This easy to use smartwatch has gone viral across the United States. It's selling out and we wanted to find out why...</strong></p>
        <p>Forever, big tech companies have been ripping their customers off with outrageous prices on new gadgets. These product come to market with barely any new features and higher prices. But now, one tech startup is turning the $5 billion smartwatch market upside down.</p>
        <p>This company is <strong>KoreTrak</strong> and it's found a way to offer feature packed (even geeks agree) smartwatches at a fraction of the price to consumers.</p>

        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        <img src="assets/img/samrt-watch-img_2.jpg" alt="samrt-watch-img">
        <p><strong>Meet KoreTrak.</strong></p>
        <p>Founded by a team of renegade engineers who are experts in health tech. They joined forces with a team of watch designers to create the KoreTrak.</p>
        <p><strong>A Simple Mission: KoreTrak was made to combine the benefits of a digital watch, fitness band, health monitor and wireless bluetooth in an attractive luxury case.</strong></p>
        <p>It feels natural on your wrist, is lightweight and more comfortable than most hard metal luxury watches we tried.</p>
        <p>Like to swim, run outdoors or accidentally bang a door jam? Not to worry, the rugged shell and scratch resistant touchscreen glass, <strong>makes this watch nearly indestructible.</strong></p>
        <p>The KoreTrak is not just any smartwatch. Yes, alert phone calls, count steps, monitoring sleeping patterns, message alerts, etc. all great to have. But in my opinion, the KoreTrak has a particular set of health features that makes it <strong>the next generation of smartwatch.</strong></p>
        <p>These feature stand out from other competitors because they  <strong>could potentially save your life...</strong> what is that worth to you?</p>

        <h2>How Much Does The KoreTrak Cost?</h2>
        <p>If you look at the features of the KoreTrak it would’t be surprising to see a price tag of up to $500. Which would still be lower than most of its competitors (some cost over $1,000).</p>
        <p>That’s why we were stunned to learn the company sells this watch for just $49 (thanks to a 50% promo ending soon).</p>

        <p>Since KoreTrak is a direct-to-consumer brand, they spend no money on advertising.</p>
        <p>They also only sell Online so they can cut out any middle-men (like retailers) who just jack up the prices the consumer pays.</p>
        <p>When you buy from a big brand, you aren’t only paying for the product, you are paying for all the enormous costs they have as a company.</p>
        <p>You’re helping to pay their rent, their CEO’s salary, their advertising cost, etc.</p>
